            “We will stay by the side of those who long for freedom and we will confront their oppressors” VP Mike Pence said at a recent White House event in reference to Nicaragua and Venezuela.
    
    Nicaragua has been embroiled in turmoil for the last three weeks. The daily protests by the Nicaraguan people started when the government illegally reformed the country’s social security law, increasing the required contributions by employees, employers and even retirees. This was the straw that broke the camel’s back for a country that has endured through eleven years of a growing dictatorship by Daniel Ortega. Ortega has slowly violated constitutional rights by stealing elections, censoring media and even named his spouse Vice-President.
    
    The government’s violent response to the protests added fuel to the fire and escalated the situation quickly to a human rights crisis. The government through the police, snipers and armed thugs has openly used live ammunition against unarmed peaceful protestors. According to a preliminary investigation by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (ICHR) the results were gross violations of civil rights including 76 dead, 868 injured, with many more missing and tortured.
    
    The Nicaraguan people are relentless in their new pursuit for freedom and continue with daily non-violent protests. On mothers day Nicaragua organized a protest to accompany the mothers of the martyrs in their mourning. The streets were covered in a sea of black, with attendance estimated at more than 400,000. The evening ended in tragedy as government actors opened fire on the multitude compromised of students, workers, peasants, women, children and elderly. Leaving at least 11 more dead and many injured.
    
    You may ask yourself, why should the United States care about what happens in a small country in Central America? The United States holds themselves as a proud beacon for the principles of democracy, freedom and defense of human rights. VP Mike Pence has recently said: “The people of Nicaragua deserve better than the worsening repression of Daniel Ortega’s government.” United Nations Ambassador Nikki Healy speaking to the Council of the Americas on Nicaragua stated, “There is no substitute for strong US leadership, based on our values of political and economic freedom and respect for human rights”
    
    However, there are more practical reasons the United States should care about Nicaragua. Instability in the region increases the United States’ immigration issues, adversely affects the war on drugs and could pose a national security risk.
    
    Until now Nicaragua has escaped being overtaken by gangs which are abound in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. This has led to much lower immigration from Nicaragua to the United States in comparison to its northern triangle neighbors who account for the highest growing numbers of immigrants into the United States. If the situation in Nicaragua continues to deteriorate it is reasonable to assume that legal and illegal immigration from Nicaragua would increase adding to the United States’ already immense influx of Central American immigrants.
    
    During the 1980s Ortega’s government provided safe passage to drug traffickers from South America. Ortega was known at the time to work with drug lords. There are pictures of Pablo Escobar’s associates and the Nicaraguan military unloading a plane full of cocaine. Pablo Escobar himself allegedly received asylum in Nicaragua while hiding from the DEA and Colombian law enforcement. After Ortega lost power in 1990, the United States invested significant resources into making Nicaragua an ally on the war on drugs. It donated assets, training and funds to bulk up Nicaragua’s armed forces making them into the region’s most efficient drug impounders. With the ensuing instability and the United States pressuring Ortega, he will likely turn to his old friends. The United States stands to lose a valuable ally on the war on drugs. Venezuela has already gone this route. Ambassador Healy recently called them a “criminal narco state”. Ortega is bound to continue following the Venezuelan way.
    
    Instability in Nicaragua could create a threat to US national security right in their backyard. During the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, the Al-Qaeda perpetrators had five falsified Nicaraguan passports in their possession. The bombing investigation determined that there was no direct connection between the Sandinistas and the bombings. However, the Sandinistas did give passports to foreign sympathizers and thousands of passports were unaccounted for after they lost power in 1991. Ortega has been friendly with radical militias in the past and is also friendly with Cuba, Venezuela, Iran and Russia.
    
    Nicaragua has also become a hotbed for US investors and retirees. There is a large amount of Americans and American assets within the country. The Department of State is still to this day negotiating with the Nicaraguan government for adequate compensation to Americans whose property was confiscated during Ortega’s first term in the 1980s. With a dwindling economy and his cash pipeline from Venezuela dry, the odds are Ortega will return to his confiscating ways, which will affect Americans.
    
    It is important for the United States to continue to pressure the Ortega for a democratic resolution. The European Parliament has already approved a damaging resolution against the Nicaraguan government. This forced the Nicaraguan private sector to finally publicly demand anticipated elections and put pressure on Ortega. The US has several options that could prove effective in forcing Ortega to take this route such as the Magnistky Act, the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA), and, UN and OAS sanctions.
    
    The Nicaraguan people are trying to avoid falling into the despair of a civil war and are valiantly surging forward through the bullets with peaceful manifestations. For them to be successful they will need the help of the international community, specially the United States. As UN Ambassador Healy stated: “The prosperity of the United States is critically tied to the prosperity of the (western) hemisphere”.
